        <div class="video-title">Inline Engine</div>
        <div class="video-description">The straight engine (also called inline engine) is a piston engine where all of the cylinders are aligned in a row along the crankshaft. Most straight engines have four or six cylinders, however straight engines have ranged from two cylinders to fourteen cylinders. A straight engine is easier to build than an equivalent flat engine or V engine, since it uses one cylinder head rather than two. Inline engines are also narrower than flat engines or V engines, however they are longer and can be taller. The engine balance characteristics of a straight engine depend on the number of cylinders and the firing interval.</div>

        <div class="video-title">Boxer Engine</div>
        <div class="video-description">A “boxer” engine is one with cylinders positioned horizontally instead of vertically — the latter configuration found in inline and V-type engines — and the pistons move in the opposite direction from each other. The official engineering term for these engines is horizontally opposed, but they are called “boxer” engines because the horizontal movement of the pistons resembles the actions of a boxer’s fists. They also are called “flat” or “pancake” engines because they are shorter in height compared to inline and V-type engines. This gives boxer engines a lower center of gravity, which engineers say improves a vehicle’s handling.</div>

        <div class="video-title">V Type Engine</div>
        <div class="video-description">A V engine, sometimes called a Vee engine, is a common configuration for internal combustion engines. It consists of two cylinder banks—usually with the same number of cylinders in each bank—connected to a common crankshaft. These cylinder banks are arranged at an angle to each other, so that the banks form a "V" shape when viewed from the front of the engine. V engines typically have a shorter length than equivalent inline engines, however the trade-off is a larger width. V6, V8 and V12 engines are the most common layout for automobile engines with 6, 8 or 12 cylinders respectively.</div>

        <div class="video-title">Rotary Engine</div>
        <div class="video-description">The Wankel engine is a type of internal combustion engine using an eccentric rotary design to convert pressure into rotating motion. The concept was invented and proven by German engineer Felix Wankel, and the commercially feasible engine designed by German engineer Hanns-Dieter Paschke. The rotary engine is an internal-combustion engine in which the combustion chambers and cylinders rotate with the driven shaft around a fixed control shaft to which pistons are affixed; the gas pressures of combustion are used to rotate the shaft.</div>
